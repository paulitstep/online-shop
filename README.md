<h1>Online Shop (E-commerce)</h1>

My second project is a <b>full-featured website of a fictional bookstore</b>. The goal of this project is to gain more detailed knowledge of Django framework.

So far my e-commerce site consists of 7 applications: Accounts, Addresses, Billing, Carts, Orders, Products and Search. 

Obviously, for back-end purposes I used Python Web framework <i>Django</i>. Front-end is implemented with the help of <i>HTML/CSS</i>, <i>Bootstrap
CSS framework</i> and <i>jQuery JavaScript library</i>.

This project is not finished yet. Add-ons are coming!

Add-ons:
<ul>Custom User Model</ul>
